### About the Project

I approached the local Dufftown hairdresser, Hair by Julie to develop a website because they had no digital presence apart from a Google Business listing. They also asked me to assist with their SEO and social media because their previous efforts hadn't been successful.

After meeting with the owner on several occassions to discuss what her business was about and how to promote it, we agreed I would create a website, update their Google business listing and revitalise their existing Facebook page as well as instructing her how to use it. 

The goal for this project was to increase her customer base, showcase her services and put her business on the digital map. I would do this by emphasising their USPs: their history as the oldest hairdresser in the town and their customer centric friendly behaviour.

I chose a single-page design for their website that would introduce users to their history, employees and products. It starts with a hero section of their storefront so users will be able to identify the shop if they visit. There's employee bio carousels introducing the staff and testimonial carousels so users can find out what the hairdressers is like. Finally, there's contact information, opening hours and everything else users will need to make the trip there.

Utilising their existing colour scheme and shop signage, I created a logo and typography for their branding which I carried forward into the website and Facebook page. Once, I designed their Facebook profile picture and cover photo, optimised the settings and showed them how to post, I gave them control of the account.
